##CHECK SCORE OF OBSERVATIONS ON PCs

##with rotation = varimax
#PCA is used to describe as much of the variation in the first few axes. 
#Here, we first center the variables to have a mean of zero and then rotate the axes to 
#reduce the dimensions or cover the maximum variation.
#Rotation is done so that the first axis contains as much variation as possible, 
#the second axis contains as much of the remaining variation and so on. 
#Change of coordinates used in PCA is known as Varimax rotation. 
#It maximizes the sum of the variances of the squared loadings as all the 
###coefficients will be either large or near zero####, with few intermediate values.

#The goal is to associate each variable to at most one factor. 
#The interpretation of the results of the PCA will be simplified.
